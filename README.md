# Used Car Price Predictor

https://github.com/Harshit-Chaudhry/Used-Car-Price-Predictor/blob/main/image%20copy.png
**Project Overview**

This project predicts used car prices using machine learning.  It considers features like make, model, year, mileage, and condition to estimate fair market values, benefiting both buyers and sellers.

**Features**

* **Data Collection & Preprocessing:**
    * Data sourced from Kaggle, Web Scraping.
    * Data cleaning included handling missing values, outliers, and converting categorical features.
* **Feature Engineering:**
    * Engineered features like vehicle age, mileage brackets, and brand popularity.
* **Model Building:**
    * Trained models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
    * Model evaluation using R-squared, MSE, and RMSE.
* **Model Selection & Tuning:**
    * Selected the best model via hyperparameter tuning.
* **Deployment (Optional):**
    * Deployed as a web app using Streamlit - Framework.

**Technologies Used**

* **Languages:** Python
* **ML Libraries:** scikit-learn, XGBoost *(Example Libraries)*
* **Data Libraries:** pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn
* **Web Framework (Optional):** Flask, Streamlit
